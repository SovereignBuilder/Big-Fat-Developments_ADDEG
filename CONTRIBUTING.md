# Contributing to ADDEG

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Project Status

This project is a **"seed"**. It is a functional tool that serves a specific purpose, but it is **not** a commercially supported product. There is no roadmap, and no long-term maintenance is guaranteed.

## How to Contribute

We welcome forks and contributions! If you have an improvement, bug fix, or new feature:

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Create a **feature branch**.
3.  Submit a **Pull Request (PR)**.

## Expectations

- **No SLA:** Review times for PRs or Issues may vary significantly.
- **Self-Sufficiency:** We encourage you to fork and adapt the tool to your specific needs if the upstream project does not move in your desired direction.
- **Code Style:** Please attempt to match the existing code style (ESLint/Prettier configuration is minimal, so just follow the patterns in `src/`).

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's [MIT License](./LICENSE).
